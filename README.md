# University of Auckland projects

### Throughout my studies in University of Auckland since 2019 until now that im currently in 3rd year of my degree in Computer Science, I have made several interesting project assignments that I would like to share:


##### **YEAR 1 PROJECTS**
* ConnectFourGame *<Python>* (CS130 - Introduction to Software Fundamentals)
We created a game of Connect Four where we played with the computer bot as our opponent. It's a normal Connect Four game but this time, we are playing in a console style format instead of graphics. We are using "X" and "O", where user is "O" and computer is "X". Our initial given color was suppose to be console default color, however for user to be able to easily identify which nodes are theirs, I allow user to choose their own colors, in order to differentiate the color to the computer's I use different color which is in contrast of user's color. I also added a "need help?" if user got stuck on where to put, the program will try to give a guide where user can achieve a score and I also added a bit of creativity in this "need help with the "Time" system. I tried to make the program as realistic as possible to how a board game in computers usually works so I added other features to the original template. Further details regarding the program can be found in  the description file located in  the ConnectFourGame directory.


#####**YEAR 2 PROJECTS**
* BounceAppBasic *<Java>* (CS230 - Object Oriented Software Development)
In this project, we created a DVD loading style bouncing program. First we implemented the "screen" for the shapes to bounce around within that screen border in the AnimationPanel.java before constructing the shapes: Rectangle, Square, Ellipse, Pyramid and OverlappedSquare which extends the MovingShape class. After constructing the shapes, we also added an extra "movement" which is the fall movement, where once the shape reaches the very bottom of the screen, it will go back up and starts falling in a loop. It's a really simple bouncing program, further implementations are done in the [BounceApp](https://github.com/NatRivers/assignment/tree/main/bounceApp) project
* BounceApp *<Java>* (CS230 - Object Oriented Software Development)
* Movie Making Web *<Python>* (CS235 - Software Development Methodologies)

#####**YEAR 3 PROJECTS**
* Book Program Discussion *<JavaScript>* (CS345 - Human-computer Interaction)
