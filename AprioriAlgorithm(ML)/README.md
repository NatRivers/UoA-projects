# Project Description  
A Machine Learning project about Apriori Algorithm. We are tasked to read a supermarket purchase database in csv format and find the combination of the purchase of each data to calculate the support value, confidence value and lift value. This is to check the validity and how often customers given in the csv purchase the combination of products as well as the pattern of purchase.

Program is using Python (Jupyter notebook ipynb). I provided the question paper of the assignment in Assignment2.pdf as well as the answers in Assignment2Answers.pdf.
